Problem Set 4 for CSCI E-15

###Live URL of my P4:
http://p4.bryanmiller.me/

###Description of the project:  
This is a degree tracker that lets you know your course plans and GPA.  It has three
databases, the user database, and also stores an account in a database, and it also has
a database for the course information.  Please keep this project secret
as it is currently being marketed to HES by my internship provider.  I will try to 
keep my CSS3 and HTML5 code validated as such, but I am continually updating my code.

###Demo information:

###A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project:  
I used some Google Fonts, as well as a concept from my internship provider, but
all of the code is mine.  I utilized Susan Buck's flash message creation and changed
 some things in it to meet my needs.
